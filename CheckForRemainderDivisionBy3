Write a JavaScript function divisionBy3(value) that finds the sum of digits of 
integer number n (n > 9) and checks if the sum is divided by 3 without remainder. 
Write JS program divisionChecker.js to check a few numbers. The result should be 
printed on the console (“the number is divided by 3 without remainder” or “the 
number is not divided by 3 without remainder”). Run the program through Node.js.
