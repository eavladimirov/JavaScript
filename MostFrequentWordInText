/*
Write a JavaScript function findMostFreqWord(value) that finds the most frequent word 
in a text and prints it, as well as how many times it appears in format 
"word -> count". Consider any non-letter character as a word separator. 
Ignore the character casing. If several words have the same maximal frequency, 
print all of them in alphabetical order. Write JS program frequentWord.js that 
invokes your function with the sample input data below and prints the output at 
the console.
